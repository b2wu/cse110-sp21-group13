## Dave's story (challenges + goals)
Dave just got out of his second divorce and wants to pick himself up. He has a stressful life being a Marketing Manager, and needs something to help him be organized and put his feelings down. His friend Benji recommended yoga, and trying to add it in his weekly routine stresses him out more because there’s just so much he feels like he has to do. He expresses this to his friend, and his friend Benji recommends that Dave start bullet journaling to manage his schedule and as an outlet for his thoughts. Dave actually hates writing on paper now after signing divorce papers, so he wants to find a digital alternative and finds one online called 13ullet. Dave starts planning goals (attending yoga consistently, deadlines for the company, etc) for himself and keeps track of his schedule on a monthly and weekly basis, and is actually enjoying this form of self care mixed with productivity.
