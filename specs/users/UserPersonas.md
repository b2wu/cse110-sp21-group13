“I get 3 hours of sleep every day” - Rachael

General Background:
Rachael owns more devices than she knows what to do with, and juggles at least 3 as she goes about her day. She goes to many community service events a day, while also juggling a full course load.

Challenges and Goals:
	Rachael is an active member of her community. Her busy schedule takes her all over the college, and she uses a variety of devices to access her schedule. She has been laying out a general daily schedule in a notepad, however she is finding that it is hard to manage. Recently having discovered the bullet journal philosophy, she wishes to integrate it into her daily routine. To keep track of her day, she wishes to bullet journal but doesn’t want to carry around a physical notebook everywhere she goes. Due to the many locations her daily routine takes her, she needs access to her bullet journal on a variety of devices.

“I may be retired and blind, but my life is busier than ever” - Dolores

General Background
	She lives in a senior living facility and is an avid gardener. She has her own laptop and a phone. Her husband died a decade ago. She is active in the local gardening community and maintains a small garden outside of her apartment in the building. She’s blind in one eye and has extreme light sensitivity in the other.

Challenges and Goals 
She heard about the bullet journal philosophy from one of her friends at a local senior center. Dolores believes it may be difficult for her to remember the tenants of the bullet journal philosophy and as such she wants a program that rigorously adheres to said philosophy. Having a sensitivity to light, she requires a darker interface for the application. Being forgetful, Dolores would like to be reminded of tasks she has yet to complete from the previous day, like gardening and volunteering.

“Idk man, it’s just so much on my mind rn idk how to keep track of everything without them” - Dave, texting Benji

General Background:
Dave just got out of his second divorce and wants to pick himself up. He has a stressful life being a Marketing Manager, and needs something to help him be organized and put his feelings down. Dave really loves pottery and yoga, which he documents religiously with his Desktop PC, iPhone, and iPad. He has invested his life savings into Dogecoin, which is definitely unrelated to the divorces.

Dave's story (challenges + goals):
His friend Benji recommended yoga, and trying to add it in his weekly routine stresses him out more because there’s just so much he feels like he has to do. He expresses this to his friend, and his friend Benji recommends that Dave start bullet journaling to manage his schedule and as an outlet for his thoughts. Dave actually hates writing on paper now after signing divorce papers, so he wants to find a digital alternative and finds one online called 13ullet. Dave starts planning goals (attending yoga consistently, deadlines for the company, etc) for himself and keeps track of his schedule on a monthly and weekly basis, and is actually enjoying this form of self care mixed with productivity.
