# Meeting Note for 04/21/2021
### Type of Meeting: Brainstorm
### Attendance: No absence
### Time: 4pm-6pm(Pacific)
### Agenda
Opening notes:
- Please start submitting standups daily, they take ~30 seconds
Project Organization (first ~30 min):
- For styling, follow the Google Style Guide (provides a concise style guide. no reason to waste time debating and designing our own): https://google.github.io/styleguide/jsguide.html
- For PRs, use scratch/feature/[issue description], scratch/bug/[issue description], etc for branch names. Ensure an issue exists for whatever it is you're working on. Include reviewers, primarily consisting of sub-team members
- Code reviews should mostly be cursory, consisting of giving feedback on styling and general implementation. Testing will fall onto QE and is not a part of code review. It should not take an excessive amount of time to review a PR and as such you should be looking at PRs you're pulled into
- Outline issue templates
- Create Projects on GitHub repo
Outlining Bullet Journal (remaining time):
- What features should our bullet journal include?
- Review 'competition'; other bullet journals
- Sketch out interface and general flow of application
